## Redux Primer

***Reducers***
Def.  A function that returns a piece of the application's state.

Because our application can have many different pieces of state,
we can have many different reducers.

    Ex) Book App => two pieces in application state:
        1.  List of books
        2.  Currently selected book

        We could have two reducers.  One for producing the list of books,
        the other for producing the currently selected book.

Reducers produce the value of our state.
    
    Ex) Application State - Generated by Reducers:
        {
            books: [ {title:'Harry Potter'}, {title:'JavaScript'} ],
            activeBook : {title:'JavaScript: The Good Parts'}
        } 

Here, we have the Books reducer and the ActiveBook reducer.

Now, let's write a function that produces the value of our state.  

    For the Books reducer, it should return an array of objects, with each object being the title of the book.  And that array should be assigned to the key 'books' of the application state.

***combineReducers()***
This function defines how we create our application state:

        const rootReducer = combineReducers({
            books: BooksReducer
        });

***Containers***
Def.  A container is a special React component that has direct access to the 'state' produced by Redux.  

Recall that React and Redux are separete libraries.  A third library, React/Redux, is needed to bridge the two.

Created a BookList component and promoted it to a container.

How do we choose which component becomes a container?

    1.  BookList - cares about when the list of books changes
    2.  BookDetail - cares when the active book changes

Only the most parent component that uses a particular piece of 'state' needs  to be connected to Redux.
